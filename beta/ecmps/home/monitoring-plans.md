### Monitoring Plans

The monitoring plan describes how a facility (monitoring configuration) monitors its emissions. Monitoring plan data define relationships between stacks, pipes, and units, specify locations at a facility from which emissions are monitored, and identify systems of monitoring equipment by detailing the individual system components. Monitoring plan data also provide operational characteristics and qualifications for certain special types of monitoring (e.g., low mass emissions monitoring). A draft version of the monitoring plan reporting instructions can be found [here].
