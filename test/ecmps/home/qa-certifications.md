### QA & Certifications

**This data is not included as part of the initial beta release and will be added with updates in 2022**

QA and certification tests are required for all types of monitoring systems. Test extension or exemption data indicate variances from prescribed testing requirements or extensions to the normal QA testing schedule. QA or certification events (e.g., monitor replacements), as well as data elements for submitting an electronic certification application when certifications are required, are submitted when there is either diagnostic or recertification testing of specific monitoring systems or components.
