If performing some sort of analysis on the data, we generally recommend summing the hourly pollutant mass and heat input values for the selected time period and then dividing the resulting total pollutant mass value by the total heat input value to calculate the aggregated rate value."

Instead, for each operating hour the Hourly gross load rate must be multiplied by Operating Time for that hour. Then the resulting hourly load values are summed to the aggregate level."

Emissions data by fuel type is generally not available for units that measure their emissions via stack-mounted CEMS (continuous emissions monitoring systems), because the CEMS sample the stack gas continuously, no matter what fuel is being combusted during an operating hour. Emissions data by fuel type may be available for units that only combust gaseous or liquid fuels, if the type of fuel and quantity are measured and reported each hour using one or more fuel flow monitoring systems"
