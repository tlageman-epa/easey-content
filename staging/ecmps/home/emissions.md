### Emissions

**This data is not included as part of the initial beta release and will be added with updates in 2022**

Emissions data are hourly values for measured parameters, calculated hourly emissions values, instrument calibration data, and aggregated summary data. An emissions file contains one calendar quarter of hourly and aggregate emissions measurements for a specified unit or group of related units, including stacks and pipes. Each unit that is required to submit emissions data for a particular calendar quarter must be included in one and only one emissions file for that quarter. Each emissions file should contain all relevant operating, daily quality assurance, and emissions data for all units, common stacks, multiple stacks, or common pipes that were in a common monitoring configuration for any part of the quarter.
