# About CAMPD

## What is CAMPD?

The Clean Air Markets Program Data (CAMPD) web application is the data publication warehouse for allowance, compliance, emissions and facility/unit attributes data collected under EPAâ€™s federal market-based trading programs: Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), CSAPR Update, Revised CSAPR Update, Acid Rain Program (ARP), and other retired programs.

CAMPD provides current and historical data using REST APIs which will be accessible via the Clean Air Markets (CAM) API portal in a future release.

The Clean Air Markets Division welcomes all feedback, comments and/or suggestions via our Contact Page, to ensure we maintain user friendly and intuitive products for our diverse community of users.
